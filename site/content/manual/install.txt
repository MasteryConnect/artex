h2(#latex). Installing LaTeX

First, you'll need LaTeX.  I recommend "the official site":http://www.latex-project.org/ftp.html for more details.

h3. Configuration

You'll need to make sure @pdflatex@ and @latex@ are available in your @PATH@ environment variable (or equivalent).  If using RTeX "as a Rails plugin":/manual/rails.html, make sure they're in @PATH@ for the Rails process owner.

h2(#gem). Installing the RTeX Rubygem

The easiest (and recommended) way to install RTeX is by using "Rubygems":http://rubygems.org.

  sudo gem install rtex
  
The standalone executable, @rtex@, should not be available.  For information on using the standalone executable, see the "RTeX Executable":/manual/executable.html page.
  
h2(#rails). Installing the Rails plugin

If you'd like to use RTeX as a Rails template handler, install it with:

  rtex --install /path/to/your/app
  
It's also possible to unpack the entire gem to @vendor/plugins/rtex@, but it's not recommended.

For information on how to use RTeX from within your Rails application, see the "Rails page":/manual/rails.html.
